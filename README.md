# Checkpoint-Based Governance (CBG)
*A Protocol Framework for Accountable Human–AI Collaboration*  
Version 2.0 · October 2025  

---

## Overview
**Checkpoint-Based Governance (CBG)** defines how humans and AI systems collaborate responsibly through structured oversight, documented arbitration, and measurable accountability.  
It bridges the gap between *AI regulation that demands oversight* and *organizations that need practical governance systems*.

CBG introduces a structured pattern of **decision checkpoints** that ensure humans verify, decide, and log outcomes before AI-driven actions proceed — creating visible, measurable accountability without slowing innovation.

## Why It Matters
Regulations like the EU AI Act and frameworks such as NIST AI RMF call for “effective human oversight,” yet offer little guidance on implementation.  
CBG provides the *how*: an operational model that scales across teams, industries, and risk levels.

### Core Benefits
- Maintains **human authority** over AI outputs  
- Prevents **automation bias and drift**  
- Produces **audit-ready documentation**  
- Delivers **15–20% performance gains** in structured collaboration environments  
- Scales for low- to high-risk use cases  

---

## Framework Architecture
CBG operates through four repeating phases at each checkpoint:

1. **AI Contribution** – AI provides an output or recommendation  
2. **Checkpoint Evaluation** – Output is reviewed against set criteria  
3. **Human Arbitration** – Human approves, modifies, or rejects  
4. **Decision Logging** – Action proceeds only after the decision and rationale are recorded  

This enforces traceable accountability across all AI–human interactions.

## Reference Implementations
| Framework | Purpose | Domain |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **HAIA-RECCLIN** | Role-based checkpoint collaboration | Multi-AI workflows |
| **HAIA-SMART** | Content quality & brand governance | Marketing & communications |
| **Factics** | Fact-to-KPI verification | Measurement & outcomes |
| **HEQ / FID** | Human-AI collaboration metrics | Research & assessment |

Together, these form the **HAIA Systems Suite**, demonstrating CBG’s scalability from governance structure to content quality and measurement.
